# To-Do List (Simple Task Manager)

This is a small, easy-to-use to‑do list you can run in any web browser. It lets you write down tasks, mark them as done, edit them, and remove them. Your tasks are saved in your browser, so they will still be there when you refresh or reopen the page.

## What you can do

- Add a new task by typing in the box and clicking **Add** (or pressing Enter)
- See your tasks in a scrollable list
- Click the circle to mark a task as done (it gets crossed out)
- Click the task text to edit it
- Remove a single task using the small **Delete** link
- Remove all tasks at once using **Delete All**
- See how many tasks you have in total

## How to use it (no install needed)

1. Download or clone this folder to your computer.
2. Open the file `index.html` in your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).

That’s it. There’s no server or setup required.

## What’s inside each file

- `index.html` – The page structure (what you see on screen)
- `style.css` – The look and feel (colors, spacing, layout)
- `script.js` – The behavior (add/edit/delete tasks, save tasks)

## Where your tasks are saved

Your tasks are stored in your browser’s “local storage.” This means:

- They stay on your device only (nothing is uploaded anywhere)
- They remain after you refresh or close the tab
- If you open the page in a different browser or on another device, you will get a fresh (empty) list

## Troubleshooting

- If the list doesn’t update, try refreshing the page.
- If you don’t see your tasks anymore, your browser may have cleared site data.
- If the **Add** button doesn’t work, make sure you typed something in the box first.

## For the curious (optional)

This project uses:

- **HTML** for the basic page layout
- **CSS** for styling
- **JavaScript** to make the page interactive and save tasks in your browser
